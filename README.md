# Rules/Procedures

* Each contest lasts for 4 weeks.
* Late entries are permitted.
* To enter a contest, the contestant must add their name to the list of competitors in the contest and submit a PR to the main repo (MelaByte/<contest-name>).
* Contests will have a folder in the source tree and an issue associated with them.
* A contest cannot start unless it has at least 3 contestants.
* At the start of each contest, each contestant will be @'ed in a comment on the contest issue.
* Projects must be opensource and be on GitHub.
* Contestants cannot start working on their project until after they have been @'ed.
* After the four weeks are done, each contestant must submit a PR with a link to their project's repo and a demo/installation page.
* Each contestant must then submit a PR and specify whose project they think is the best.
* Contestants can't vote for themselves.
* After all contestants have submitted a vote PR or after a week has passed after the end, rankings will be set.
* The rankings will show all contestants and their projects in descending order, sorted by the number of votes.
* The same person cannot win twice in a row. If such a situation arises, they will be put in second place.
* The repo (and future website) will contain a list of past first place winners and their project.

# Core Tenets
## 1. Transparency
The entire process can be audited via the git commit history. Everyone can see the PR submissions and who did what.
## 2. Fairness
Everyone has a fair chance to win. Everyone will have four full weeks to work on their project. That should be enough time even for inexperienced programmers to learn some of the required skills and make something that they can be proud of.
